# ML-Final-Project
Final project for Ellie Zhang, Alex Mo, and Christine O'Connor


To run our model, you must first download the dataset from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images

You will also need to make sure your IDE has all the necessary libraries/packages installed and working properly: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.

After this initial setup, you will need to add the paths of the downloaded train and test datasets into the train_dir and test_dir variables, respectively. Once this step is completed, you should be able to simply run the model!
